This is a video game created by 3 people, programmed in Z80 assembly language (with the help of cpctelera) and designed for the Amstrad machine. This project has been developed over 7 weeks, including the learning phase, where an ECS (Entity Component System) engine has been implemented for the development of this video game.

Mr. Og the Sampler is an arcade game inspired by the classic Guzzler, released in 1986. Our project aims to give a twist to Guzzler's gameplay and dynamics by creating increasingly shorter levels that speed up the gaming sessions and make the experience more enjoyable.
